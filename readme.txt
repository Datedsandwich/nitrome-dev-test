Unity Games Developer – Test For Interview
-------------------------------------------------

We would like you to demonstrate your abilities in Unity 
by completing the following test piece.




Included in this zip file is an assets folder 'test assets' where you can
find all of the graphical assets you will need. 

1.Build a simple platform engine which incorporates tiles and a character. 
Use the animation and tile assets given in 'tile assets' for the graphics.

2.Make the character walk and jump using the arrow keys. This is an important part of the process 
and we will be looking at how well we feel the character flows and how satisfying it is to move about. 

3.Incorporate two types of ground tiles in your piece: normal tiles (which 
the character can jump up through but stand on from the top) and stone tiles (which are solid - the character 
would hit his head on them and not go through them in any direction).

4.Incorporate a collectable coin item which increases the players score when 
collected. Display this score on screen.

5.Make sure that the platform engine loads in its level data from an external 
xml file.

6.Make sure that your code is clean and easy to read.

7.Anything else you want to add to show of your skills and enthusiasm is always welcome but would not be a 
substitute for a solid and polished implementation of what is described above :)

Please supply all the Unity project files and a standalone executable build.
